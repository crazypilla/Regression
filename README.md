# Regression
The main objective of the project is to implement Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machine with variable parameters and solve the problem of
handwritten digit classification. 

2 Your tasks
• Implement Logistic Regression and give the prediction results.
• Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) toolbox to perform classification.
• Write a report to explain the experimental results with these 2 methods.

2.1 Logistic Regression

2.2 Support Vector Machines
In this part of assignment, you are asked to use the Support Vector Machine tool in sklearn.svm.SVM to
perform classification on our data set.
Your task is to learn the SVM model and
compute accuracy of prediction with respect to training data, validation data and testing using the following
parameters:
• Using linear kernel (all other parameters are kept default).
• Using radial basis function with value of gamma setting to 1 (all other parameters are kept default).
• Using radial basis function with value of gamma setting to default (all other parameters are kept
default).
• Using radial basis function with value of gamma setting to default and varying value of C (1, 10, 20, 30, · · · , 100)
and plot the graph of accuracy with respect to values of C in the report.
